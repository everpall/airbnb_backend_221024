## Poetry-Django Template on GitPod

Initialize Django Project which runs on fine-tuned python virtual environment, [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/).   
Poetry has excellent feature on not only Dependencies Management but also exclusively provide `dependencies lock`, `packages batch install&update` which is not provided from other python venvs.

Modification added in [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) which automatically set venv on project, install django, start django project, set port on localhost for development, solve csrf-problem and quick admin panel configuration.   
To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.   

## How to configurate Django Project Manually

  ```
3. Add Django with Poetry and Start Django Project
  - Install Django with Poetry
  ```shell
  poetry add django
  ```
  - Start Django Project
  ```shell
  poetry run django-admin startproject config .
  ```
4. Set or Overwrite [`config.settings`](./config/settings.py) to operate server successfully
  ```python3
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost"]
  CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ["https://*.ws-us72.gitpod.io"]

  TIME_ZONE = 'Asia/Seoul'
  ```
5. Preparation to access Admin Panel
